Include the icon fonts stylesheet—in your website ```<head>``` or via @import in CSS—from jsDelivr and get started in seconds.

<br />
In your HTMLfile
<br />
<br />

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
```
<br />
Or, in your main .css file
<br />
<br />

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css");
```

<br>

Now you can use them like this :

<br>

```html
<i class="bi-alarm"></i>
```

<br>
<b>Icons :</b> <a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/#icons" target="_blank">Bootstrap Icons</a>
